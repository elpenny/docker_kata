# Exercise 1 - Hello docker

This exercise is very short - it's main aim is to check all required prerequisites.

To run this exercise you need to have:
1. Windows 10 with WSL2 enbaled. You can try with Hyper-V but performance will be somewhat limited. In order to install WSL2, please refer to [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), in order to check if its enabled, go [here](https://superuser.com/questions/1551146/how-to-verify-that-wsl-2-is-used).
2. Docker for Windows installed. Go [here]() for instructions.
3. Linux containers enabled. 
4. Some familiar terminal shell (easiest option is to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Kata
1. Open your favourite terminal and be ready to hack!
2. Run 'docker run hello-world'
3. If you see message 'Hello from Docker!' that means you are good to go to other exercises. In case of any errors refer to Docker official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
