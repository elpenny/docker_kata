# Docker Kata

This repository contains Docker exercises in form of coding kata. It's aim is to help developers get docker knowledge and its components in easy way. Each exercise can be done separately and in no particular order but they are created in such way, that doing them inj proposed order should give most gain with minimal learning overhead.

All of the exercises are for Windows 10 with WSL 2 enabled. We are using Linux containers here, so all of this should work on any Linux distro with no problem but it is not tested yet and ome instructions may vary.
