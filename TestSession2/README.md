# Testing session #2

## Preparation

1. This is second testing session that will let you try your skills and discover where you need to practice and or read about more in-depth.
2. There is no ready answer so you must complete each step by yourself.
3. Have docker and node installed.
4. Clone into this directory example app: 
    - https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld
    - https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app
    - https://github.com/gothinkster/vue-realworld-example-app
5. this will come in handy: ```docker run -d -p 27017-27019:27017-27019 --name mongodb mongo:4.0.4```

## Aim of session
Your goals for this session are simple:
1. Understand application enough to perform next steps.
2. Dockerize it.
3. Create docker-compose stack for this app and detach postgresql as a separate container.

Simple as that, no explanation given and off you go!
