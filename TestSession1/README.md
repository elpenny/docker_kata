# Testing session #1

## Preparation

1. This is first testing session that will let you try your skills and discover where you need to practice and or read about more in-depth.
2. There is no ready answer so you must complete each step by yourself.
3. Have docker and node installed.
4. Clone into this directory example app: https://github.com/fishenal/Todos_Vuejs/tree/withfirebase


## Aim of session
Your goals for this session are simple:
1. Understand application enough to perform next step.
2. Dockerize it.

Simple as that, no explanation given and off you go!
